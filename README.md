# 🌐 [Akihiko hub](akihiko47.github.io/Akihiko-hub/) 🌐
## !old page, check [new one.](https://github.com/akihiko47/My-Projects-Page)!
This is my first experience in making websites. On this site I have posted my projects with the ability to run in the browser (this function works quite poorly, so it is better to download archives). Also, I will be very happy if you add your project to this site!

## Usage
1. You can open this website [in your browser](akihiko47.github.io/Akihiko-hub/).
2. Or you can copy the directory to make changes using ```git clone https://github.com/akihiko47/Akihiko-hub.git```

## Contributions
The main idea of this site is to add your projects freely for everyone. You can add your project, customize the card of your project, change the appearance of the site. I will be very glad if you are interested in this idea. The site is far from perfect (maybe storing all projects inside the site is not a good idea 🙃), but it's my first site, don't be strict 🥺.
